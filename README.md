# Traffic-light-control-system
This project was created for the LaunchPad TM4C123 kit. It is a state machine that implements an automated traffic light controller that is used at intersections where vehicles can travel from one direction to the other and where pedestrians can cross the street. When one of the three sensors detects the presence of vehicles or people, they communicate this information to the microcontroller, whose objective is to first halt any movement caused by the other two sensors and then permit its own movements.
